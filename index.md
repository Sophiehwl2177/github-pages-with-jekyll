# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my progress in learning about GitHub from scratch!

9 September 2020
I discovered about GitHub around 3 years ago when I started to embark on this journey. I am used to code html and css when I was a website administrator of my company website. Things were becoming more interesting day by day and I am starting to wonder if I could this off more than just the basics. I started to look for free sources in the internet and came across FreeCodeCamp, which was truly amazing. I did try other mediums to start learning programming but eventually decided to stick with FreeCodeCamps because of the friendlier flow, comprehensible structure and valuable sharings by Quincy.

However I could not maintain the discipline due to some personal issues. Today I decided to start fresh again by signing up on the CS50 free online course by David Malan, learning to use GitHub and resetting all my progress in FreeCodeCamp.

Today is the my 0 - Day.
